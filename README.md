# ESP32-S3-WROOM1-Devboard
A Custom ESP32-S3-WROOM1 N16R8 Development Board completely designed by me.

This project features raw ESP32-S3-WROOM1 N16R8 Chip to convert it into a professional development board. Several resistors are used along with capacitors for perfect circuit current flowing. 3 RGB colored LEDS are also placed on the PCB alongwith two Switch Push Buttons. A cool logo is placed on bottom right while text with each Pin is mentioned for ease of use in real life.
